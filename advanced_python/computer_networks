# transmission medium or channel 
	dependence :
		data transfer speed 
		bandwidth
		distance
		cost
## wired media/physical/conducted(guided)/ethernet network

# twisted pair cable/ethernet cable

	- sheilded or unshielded 
	- advantages :
		- low cost,low weight,flexible
		- easy to install and maintain

	- disadvantages :
		- short distances(upto 70m)
		- for longer distances repeater is used
		- supports low bandwidth 
		- speed upto 100 mbps

# coaxial cable(or coax)

	- used in cable tv transmission
	- two solid insulated conductors(common axis) 
	- inner conductor straight wire surrounded by wired mesh
	- inner core carries the signal and mesh provides the ground
	
	advantages :
		- high bandwidth,longer distance(185-200)
		- less susceptible to EM fields

	disadvantages :
		- less flexible,expensive 
		- thick 
		- difficult to install ,less flexibility

# optical fibre cable

	- optica fibre : long,thin strands/fibres of plastic/glass
	- optical fibre cable : arranged in bundle 
	- signals are modulated and transmitted in the form of light pulses from source using LED or LASER BEAM
	
	OPTICAL FIBRE : 
		CORE(PLASTIC OR GLASS) : thin glass rod at the cente through which the light travels
		CLADDING : outer optical material surrounding the core that reflects teh light back
		BUFFER COATING : plastic coating protects the cable from damage and moisture

	advantages : 
		
		- free from EMI since no electrical signal are carried 
		- secure ,high-speed transmission 
		- very long distance
		- most efficent 
	
	disadvantages :
		
		most expensive cable 
		- breakable
		- installation procedure complicated
		- high maintenance cost

# radio waves

	advantages :
		- covers larger span of area and mobility
		- propagate in omni directions
		- transmitter and reciever antenna do not need to be physically aligned
		- cheapet
		- penetrate walls
		
	disadvantages :
		- unsecure 
		- susceptible 
		- permission required
# microwaves 

	advantages :
		- cheap
		-  high data transmission speed

	disadvantages :
		- unsecured communication
		- affected by weather 
# infrared 

	- short range
  	- do not pass through solid
	- line of sight transmission
	- no government licence 
	- within short range

	- only two devices can communicate
	
# bluetooth

	- establish PAN
	- 10 m

	advantages :
		- data transfer rate is slow
		- connect upto 8 devices

# wifi (wireless fidelity) - long distance(150-200)

# satellite link

	- microwave 
	- dth,vsat,gps,satellite phones
	advantages :
		- covers larger geographical area
		- secure high quality transmission
		- 
	disadvantages :
		- very expensive 
		- slower than microwave transmission
		- legal permission
		- 

# advantages of client-server model
	- central server
	- easy troubleshooting

# cloud computing - data is a service everything is a service
	privately owned spaces : cloud
	
	PUBLIC CLOUD : common cloud service provided to multiple users on a network. operated by a third party 
		       in this , memory,hardware devices and network devices are shared by all the client(subscribers)
	
	PRIVATE CLOUD : virtual private interface provided by a individual or owned by organisation 
			eg VPN

	basics concept of cloud computing :

		iaas(infrastructure as a service) : a computer infrastruture eg.windows azure,amazon ec2
		pass(platform as a service) : integrated platform for the development,deployment and support of web applications eg, google app engine,force.com,windows azure
		saas(software as  a service) : eg.google app,microsoft office
		daas(desktop as a service) : multiple services at same time(successor of saas)

	pros :
		instant access to the entiretyof human knowledge
		- instant access to almost every of piece of media ever created(film,books)
		- instant access to friends and family in the world
	
	drawbacks :
		- privacy and security
		- no internet no access

# network devices 

1. NIC : a device that enables a computer to connect to a network and communicate
	network interface card/lan card/network interface unit(NIU) uses mac address
	alternative WLAN 

2. hub : connects multiple computers to form lan via nic, do not manage traffic, send data to each port 

3. switch : intelligent hub

4. repeater : regenerates(amplification) and retransmits 

5. gateway : connects two network

6. router : forward data packets to source machine to the destination path through shortest path 
	    network layer device 
	    connects two lans,mans,wans

7. wireless access point (WAP) : wireless newtwork to the wired network using wifi standard,wireless router, medium - air

# mac - media access control address - 48 bit address
	- communications between two nodes in network
	- hardware address/phycsical address in every nic card(ethernet card and wifi card)
	
# routing : finding apporiate path to deliver data packet

# ip address
	- 32 bits,uniquely identified

# domain name system(DNS)

	DOMAIN NAME RESOLUTION - finding ip address from domain name
	
	eg, http://www.google.com/welcome.htm (url)

		primary domain name/top level domain : com
		sub domain of com : google
		sub domain of google : www
		protocols used : http 
		pathname : welcome.htm

		
# network congestion : traffic james and poor network service 

# net-tools
	traceroute <domainname>
	nslookup <ipaddress/domainname>
	ping <ipaddress>
	ipconfig 
	netstat

	speedtest.net,pingtest.net
